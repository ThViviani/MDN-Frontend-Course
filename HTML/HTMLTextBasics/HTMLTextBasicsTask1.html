    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

    <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

    <h2>The Llama</h2>
    <p>
        Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like
        sweets,
        licking her lips as she goes.
    </p>

    <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
    <p>
        The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his
        prey.
